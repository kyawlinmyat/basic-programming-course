# Module 1: Introduction to Databases

## Overview
Welcome to the first module of the Basic Programming Course. In this module, we will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of databases.

## Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand what a database is and its importance.
- Identify different types of databases.
- Explain basic database concepts and terminology.

## Topics Covered
- What is a Database?
- Types of Databases
- Database Terminology
- Introduction to SQL

## What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Databases are used to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.

## Types of Databases
- **Relational Databases**: Use tables to store data and SQL for querying.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Designed for specific data models and have flexible schemas.
- **In-Memory Databases**: Store data in the main memory for faster access.
- **Distributed Databases**: Data is distributed across different locations.

## Database Terminology
- **Table**: A collection of related data entries.
- **Record**: A single entry in a table.
- **Field**: A single piece of data within a record.
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a record in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.

## Introduction to SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and managing database structures.

## Summary
In this module, we have introduced the basic concepts of databases, including their types and key terminology. We also provided a brief introduction to SQL, which will be covered in more detail in subsequent modules.

## Next Steps
Proceed to Module 2 where we will dive deeper into SQL and learn how to create and manipulate databases.
