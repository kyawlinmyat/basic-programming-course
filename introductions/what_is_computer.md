## What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to a set of instructions (programs). Here's how it works:

**Input**: Devices like a keyboard, mouse, or camera provide data to the computer.

**Processing**: The central processing unit (CPU) performs calculations and runs programs.

**Storage**: Data is saved in memory (RAM) and storage (hard drives or SSDs).

**Output**: The computer displays results through monitors, printers, or speakers.

### Key Components:

**CPU**: The brain of the computer, executing instructions.

**RAM**: Temporary storage that holds data for quick access while the computer is running.

**Storage**: Permanent storage for data, like documents and applications.

**Input/Output Devices**: Allow interaction with the computer, like keyboards for input and monitors for output.

### How a Computer Works

**Input** Devices: You type on a keyboard or click with a mouse.

**CPU**: The CPU processes these inputs by executing instructions.

**RAM**: Data is temporarily stored in RAM for quick access.

**Storage**: Files are saved to hard drives or SSDs.

**Output Devices**: Results are displayed on a monitor or printed.
