## What is programming?

Programming is essentially telling a computer what to do through a series of instructions written in a language it understands. Think of it as writing a recipe: each step has to be clear and precise so the computer can follow it exactly.

### Key Concepts of Programming:

**Variables**: Store data that can be used and manipulated.

**Data Types**: Define the kind of data (numbers, text, etc.).

**Loops**: Repeat a set of instructions multiple times.

**Conditionals**: Make decisions based on certain conditions (if/else statements).

**Functions**: Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

Visual Example:

> *let name = "Alice"; // Variable
> for(let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // Loop
>     if(name === "Alice") { // Conditional
>         console.log("Hello, " + name); // Function usage
>     }
> }*
