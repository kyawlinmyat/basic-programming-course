## HTML Document Structure

An HTML document has a specific structure that includes several key elements. Here is a basic example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### The `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration
The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It should always be the first line in an HTML document.

### The `<html>` Element
The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page. It contains all other elements.

### The `<head>` Element
The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as its title and links to stylesheets.

### The `<body>` Element
The `<body>` element contains the content of the HTML document, such as text, images, and links.

## Practice Exercise
Create a simple HTML document with the following structure:
1. A `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration
2. An `<html>` element
3. A `<head>` element with a title
4. A `<body>` element with a heading and a paragraph

## Summary
In this module, you learned about the basic structure of an HTML document. You should now be able to create a simple HTML page with the correct structure.
