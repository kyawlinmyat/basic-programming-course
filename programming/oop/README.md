# What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. Data is in the form of fields, often known as attributes or properties, and code is in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

OOP aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction in programming. The main benefits of OOP include modularity, reusability, and ease of maintenance.

## Benefits of OOP:
- Modularity
- Reusability
- Pluggability and Debugging Ease
