# Module 3: Practical Examples of Looping

## Overview
In this module, we will explore practical examples of using loops in programming. Loops are fundamental constructs that allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times, making our programs more efficient and concise.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand the basic concepts of loops.
- Implement `for` loops and `while` loops in your code.
- Apply loops to solve practical problems.

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Loops**
    - Definition and importance
    - Types of loops: `for` loop, `while` loop, and `do-while` loop

2. **For Loop**
    - Syntax and structure
    - Examples and use cases

3. **While Loop**
    - Syntax and structure
    - Examples and use cases

4. **Nested Loops**
    - Concept and applications
    - Examples of nested loops

5. **Loop Control Statements**
    - `break` statement
    - `continue` statement

## Practical Examples
### Example 1: Sum of Numbers
Write a program to calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers using a `for` loop.

### Example 2: Factorial Calculation
Write a program to compute the factorial of a given number using a `while` loop.

### Example 3: Multiplication Table
Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number using nested loops.

### Example 4: Fibonacci Series
Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms using a `while` loop.

## Exercises
1. Write a program to find the largest number in a list using a `for` loop.
2. Write a program to reverse a string using a `while` loop.
3. Write a program to check if a number is prime using a `for` loop.
